**Dear PayPay Engineering Hiring Team,**

I’m writing to express my interest in the Frontend Engineer position at PayPay.  
As a frontend developer with strong experience in building user-focused web products, I’m passionate about creating consistent, high-quality, and scalable interfaces that improve how millions of users interact with digital products every day.

At Wan Theory Technology (AFFiNE), I have contributed over **570 merged pull requests** to the open-source project **AFFiNE**, leading key frontend feature refactors such as the **sharing and permission flow**, **team billing experience**, and **command panel optimization**.  
My focus has always been on improving user flows and product reliability—by reducing error rates, unifying interactions across platforms, and building reusable UI foundations that make future development faster and safer.

What attracts me most to **PayPay** is its impact and engineering culture—where performance, reliability, and user experience go hand in hand.  
I admire how PayPay’s frontend team balances scalability with product empathy, and I believe my background in open-source collaboration, i18n automation, and cross-team development aligns well with that mindset.

I’m currently based in China and open to relocation to Japan.  
I’m also actively learning Japanese to better integrate into PayPay’s multicultural engineering environment.  
I would love the opportunity to contribute to PayPay’s mission of delivering seamless and delightful payment experiences to millions of users in Japan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my experience in user experience–driven frontend development can contribute to PayPay’s continued success.

Best regards,  
**JimmFly Yang**
